**Use at your own risk**

These are my dotfiles. Put up here for me to have a unified experience on my
different devices and for anyone who is looking for neat customization options
to improve their terminal experience.

## Made for...
`Mac OSX High Sierra` although it should work on most Macs.

## How to use
* `git clone https://github.com/AtaGowani/dotfiles.git`
* `cd dotfiles`
* `./apply.sh` (if that doesn't work run `bash apply.sh`) **This will overwrite your current configurations and replace them with what is above.** It will only replace the files that are in this directory.
