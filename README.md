# Ata's dotfiles
**Use at your own risk**



This are my dotfiles. Put up here for me to have a unified experience on my
different devices and for anyone who is looking for neat customization options
for your terminal experience.

## Made for...
`Mac OSX High Sierra` although it should work on most Macs.

## How to use
* Download ZIP or Fork -> Clone
* `cd` into the `dotfiles/` directory
* Run `./apply.sh` **This will overwrite your current configurations and replace them with what is above.** It will only replace the files that are in this directory.
